#Speak before you fork!

* The goal of this library is to be as abstract and generic as possible. 
* It is quite small, so we have leeway to even have parallel development branches if a feature is needed for many people but shouldn't be part of the main package
* Do you think we are doing something good? or something bad with this piece of code? Speak up!
* Make pull requests! Unless you have done something that undermines the code's quality or completely changes the scope of the library it will be approved. 
* You may get comments on your PRs but the current maintainer is definitelly not a code snob. There will be a discussion no matter what you sent. 
* Ideas for expansion are definitelly welcome. 
* If you are serious enough or you contribute significant code, I will be glad to add you to the project. 
* In any case whether you offer ideas or code you will be added in the credits of the library. 
* Have another library that does the same things as this and was created before this one? I would certainly consider a project merge. The less packages doing the same thing there are around the better everyone's life will be.
* Are you about to create another library that does the same things as this? DON'T! at least not before contacting me...
