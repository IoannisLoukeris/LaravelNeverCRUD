# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The goal for this library is to have one version under support, the latest.<br>
It is very difficult to imagine what could introduce breaking changes and as long as that is the case the library should be upgradeable to the latest version with no fuss.


| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
